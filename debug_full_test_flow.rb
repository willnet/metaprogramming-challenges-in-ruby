puts "=== COMPLETE TEST FLOW ANALYSIS ==="
puts

puts "The test flow according to test_answers_comprehensive.rb:"
puts
puts "1. Load test code (includes AcceptBlock class definition)"
puts "2. Load answer code"
puts "3. For '01_block_first_step', REMOVE AcceptBlock.call line"
puts "4. Run the test"
puts

puts "Let's trace through the EXACT test scenario:"
puts

# Step 1: Test code defines AcceptBlock
puts "STEP 1 - Test code defines:"
puts "  class AcceptBlock"
puts "    def self.call(&block)"
puts "      @result = block == MY_LAMBDA"
puts "    end"
puts "  end"
puts

# Step 2: Answer code (after removal)
puts "STEP 2 - Answer code after fix_answer_code:"
puts "  MY_LAMBDA = -> { 3 }"
puts "  # AcceptBlock.call(&MY_LAMBDA) was removed!"
puts

# Step 3: Test runs
puts "STEP 3 - Test runs:"
puts "  assert AcceptBlock.result"
puts

puts "=== THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM ==="
puts "AcceptBlock.result is nil because AcceptBlock.call was never executed!"
puts
puts "This appears to be a bug in the test design. The test cannot pass"
puts "if the line that sets AcceptBlock.result is removed."
puts
puts "=== WAIT! Let me check something... ==="
puts
puts "What if the answer is supposed to define MY_LAMBDA differently?"
puts "Or what if there's some other way to make AcceptBlock.result true?"
puts

# Let me think about this differently...
# The problem description says:
# "このメソッドを、下で用意されているMY_LAMBDAをブロック引数として渡して実行してみてください。"
# Which means "Execute this method by passing MY_LAMBDA prepared below as a block argument"

puts "Actually, looking at the problem description:"
puts "It asks to EXECUTE AcceptBlock.call with MY_LAMBDA as a block"
puts "But the test runner REMOVES that execution!"
puts
puts "This is definitely a bug in the test framework."
