puts "=== Understanding the AcceptBlock Test Issue ==="
puts

# The test code defines AcceptBlock like this:
class AcceptBlock
  class << self
    attr_accessor :result
  end

  def self.call(&block)
    @result = block == MY_LAMBDA
  end
end

puts "1. The test defines AcceptBlock with a class method 'call' that:"
puts "   - Takes a block parameter"
puts "   - Sets @result to (block == MY_LAMBDA)"
puts

# The answer code defines MY_LAMBDA like this:
MY_LAMBDA = -> { 3 }

puts "2. The answer code defines MY_LAMBDA = -> { 3 }"
puts

# The answer code calls this:
# AcceptBlock.call(&MY_LAMBDA)

puts "3. The answer code has: AcceptBlock.call(&MY_LAMBDA)"
puts "   BUT the test runner REMOVES this line!"
puts

puts "4. In test_answers_comprehensive.rb, the fix_answer_code method:"
puts "   - For problem '01_block_first_step'"
puts "   - Removes the line: AcceptBlock.call(&MY_LAMBDA)"
puts

puts "5. After removal, the test runs:"
puts "   - MY_LAMBDA is defined"
puts "   - But AcceptBlock.call is never executed"
puts "   - So AcceptBlock.result remains nil"
puts "   - The test 'assert AcceptBlock.result' fails"
puts

puts "=== The Real Issue ==="
puts "The test expects the answer to somehow make AcceptBlock.result true"
puts "WITHOUT calling AcceptBlock.call(&MY_LAMBDA)"
puts
puts "This seems like a bug in the test design because:"
puts "- The test checks AcceptBlock.result"
puts "- But prevents the answer from calling AcceptBlock.call"
puts "- There's no other way to set AcceptBlock.result to true"
puts

puts "=== Possible Solutions ==="
puts "1. The test runner should NOT remove the AcceptBlock.call line"
puts "2. OR the test should call AcceptBlock.call itself before checking result"
puts "3. OR the answer should use a different approach (but what?)"
